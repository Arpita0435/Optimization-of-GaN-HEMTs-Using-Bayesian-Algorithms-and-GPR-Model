# Optimization-of-GaN-HEMTs-Using-Bayesian-Algorithms-and-GPR-Model
This repository provides a framework for optimizing GaN HEMTs using Bayesian algorithms and GPR models. It uses Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS) for initial data generation, trains a GPR model for accurate performance prediction, and applies Bayesian optimization to iteratively refine parameters while minimizing computational costs.



# Optimization of GaN HEMTs Using Bayesian Algorithms and GPR Model

This repository contains a flowchart and associated scripts for the optimization of GaN HEMTs (Gallium Nitride High Electron Mobility Transistors) using Bayesian algorithms and Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) models. The approach leverages:

1. **Initial Parameter Sampling**: Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS) is used to generate an initial dataset for training the model.
2. **Model Training**: GPR is employed to create a predictive model for optimization.
3. **Bayesian Optimization**: An iterative process to identify optimal design parameters based on the GPR model.
4. **Simulation**: New design points are validated through simulation to ensure performance improvements.
5. **Convergence Check**: The process continues until a predefined convergence criterion is met.

### Repository Contents
- **Flowchart**: Visual representation of the optimization process.
- **Python Script**: Code for generating the flowchart using the `graphviz` library.
- **Documentation**: Detailed explanation of the methodology and steps involved.
- **Usage Instructions**: How to run the scripts and interpret the results.

### Key Highlights
- Uses advanced techniques like Bayesian optimization and GPR for high-efficiency modeling.
- Provides a systematic approach for improving GaN HEMT design parameters.
- Includes visual aids for better understanding.
